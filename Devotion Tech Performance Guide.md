## **Tech**

A computer running Unity (this project is in version 2018.3.5f1, which should be accessible via Unity Hub)
The Unity Project (accessible via this repository: https://github.com/mkai5/Devotion)
A Rehastim Device
A small bell, of the kind commonly used for puja

## Performance guidelines

The performer recites a devotional poem 10 times.
While reciting the poem, EMS, employed by the Rehastim controlled through the Unity Project, actuates the ringing of the bell.
These EMS electrodes are attached to the flexor and extensor of the right forearm.
After each recitation, the speed and intensity of the EMS pulses increases. The delay between them also decreases.
After each recitation, a third party presses right on the keyboard of the computer controlling the performance. This moves the performance, and stimulation, to the next stage. Pressing left automatically restarts the performance (from no stimulation); pressing down stops all stimulation but retains the current stage for when it is restarted.
After 10 recitations, the stimulation stops.
